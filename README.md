# Brain Invaders 2013 Dataset

Repository with basic scripts for using the Brain Invaders 2013 dataset developed at GIPSA-lab. The dataset files and their documentation are all available at 

[https://zenodo.org/record/2669187](https://zenodo.org/record/2669187)

The code of this repository was developed in **Python 3** using MNE-Python [1, 2] as tool for the EEG processing.

To make things work, you might need to install some packages. They are all listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed by doing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in your command line. 

Then, to ensure that your code finds the right scripts whenever you do `import braininvaders2013`, you should also do

```
python setup.py develop # because no stable release yet
```

Note that you might want to create a *virtual environment* before doing all these installations.
